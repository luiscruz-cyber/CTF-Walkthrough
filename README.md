# Capture the Flag (CTF) Walkthrough

This project documents the process of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in a simulated target environment through a structured Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Develop offensive security mindset through practical exercises
- Identify misconfigurations and exploitable services
- Practice enumeration, privilege escalation, and documentation

## 🗂️ Deliverable

- **CTF Write-Up (PDF):** A step-by-step walkthrough including recon, exploitation, privilege escalation, and final flag capture.

## 🔍 Tools & Techniques Used

- nmap
- gobuster
- netcat
- local privilege escalation enumeration
- Linux enumeration tools
- Manual testing and validation

## ✅ Outcome

Completed full system compromise, documented all findings, and proposed remediations for discovered vulnerabilities.
